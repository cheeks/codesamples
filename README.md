code samples
===========

There are three different examples currently:

- **sgh-fall-trends-api** - A voting system I built on Node/Express/MongoDB for Sunglass Hut. Test page included.
  - registers a vote for one of 8 men's or women's sunglasses
  - returns the top 3 items for either men or women
- **cache.js** - This CommonJS module is the client-side cacheing layer I wrote for [evb.com](http://www.evb.com). It is referenced when rendering any view
- **disco.js** - This is the source code behind the bookmarklet on from [danceparty.biz](http://www.danceparty.biz). Minify it, stick it in an anchor tag, and you're a click away from a possibly having a seizure.
